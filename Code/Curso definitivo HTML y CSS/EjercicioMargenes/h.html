        The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do 
        not make the vehicle autonomous. The activation and use of these features
        are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as
        demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory 
        approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-dri
        ving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over
        -the-air software updates.
