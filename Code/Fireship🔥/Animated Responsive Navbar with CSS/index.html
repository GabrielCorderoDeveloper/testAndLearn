        <h1>How to Learn to Code & Get a Developer Job in 2023 [Full Book]</h1>
        <p>If you want to learn to code and get a job as a developer, you're in the right place. This book will show you how.

        And yes this is the full book  for free  right here on this webpage.
        
        A few years back, one of the Big 5 book publishers from New York City reached out to me about a book deal. I met with them, but didn't have time to write a book.
        
        Well, I finally had time. And I decided to just publish this book for free, right here on freeCodeCamp.
        
        Information wants to be free, right? ðŸ™‚
        
        It may take you a few hours to read all this. But this is it. My insights into learning to code and getting a developer job.
        
        I learned all of this while:
        
        learning to code in my 30s
        then working as a software engineer
        then running freeCodeCamp.org for the past 8 years. Today, more than a million people visit this website each day to learn about math, programming, and computer science.
        I was an English teacher who had never programmed before. And I was able to learn enough coding to get my first software development job in just one year.
        
        All without spending any money on books or courses.
        
        (I did spend money to travel to nearby cities and participate in tech events. And as you'll see later in the book, this was money well spent.)
        
        After working as a software engineer for a few years, I felt ready. I wanted to teach other people how to make this career transition, too.
        
        I built several technology education tools that nobody was interested in using. But then one weekend, I built freeCodeCamp.org. A vibrant community quickly gathered around it.
        
        Along the way, we all helped each other. And today, people all around the world have used freeCodeCamp to prepare for their first job in tech.
        
        You may be thinking: I don't know if I have time to read this entire book.
        
        No worries. You can bookmark it. You can come back to it and read it across as many sittings as you need to.
        
        And you can share it on social media. Sharing: "check out this book I'm reading" and linking to it is a surprisingly effective way to convince yourself to finish reading a book.
        
        I say this because I'm not trying to sell you this book. You already "bought" this book when you opened this webpage. Now my goal is to reassure you that this book will be worth investing your scarce time in finish. ðŸ˜‰
        
        I promise to be respectful of your time. There's no hype or fluff here  just blunt, actionable tips.
        
        I'm going to jam as much insight as I can into every chapter of this book.
        
        Which reminds me: where's the table of contents?
        
        Ah. Here it is:
        
        Table of Contents
        Forward: Who is this book for?
        500 Word Executive Summary
        Chapter 1: How to Build Your Skills
        Chapter 2: How to Build Your Network
        Chapter 3: How to Build Your Reputation
        Chapter 4: How to Get Paid to Code  Freelance Clients and the Job Search
        Epilogue: You Can Do This
        Forward: Who is This Book For?
        This book is for anyone who is considering a career in software development.
        
        If you're looking for a career that's flexible, high-paying, and involves a lot of creative problem solving, software development may be for you.
        
        Of course, each of us approaches our own coding journey with certain resources: time, money, and opportunity.
        
        You may be older, and may have kids or elderly relatives you're taking care of. So you may have less time.
        
        You may be younger, and may have had less time to build up any savings, or acquire skills that boost your income. So you may have less money.
        
        And you may live far away from the major tech cities like San Francisco, Berlin, Tokyo, or Bengaluru.
        
        You may live with disabilities, physical or mental. Agism, racism, and sexism are real. Immigration status can complicate the job search. So can a criminal record.
        
        So you may have less opportunity.
        
        Learning to code and getting a developer job is going to be harder for some people that it will be for others. Everyone approaches this challenge from their own starting point, with whatever resources they happen to have on hand.
        
        But wherever you may be starting out from  in terms of time, money, and opportunity  I'll do my best to give you actionable advice.
        
        In other words: you are in the right place.</p>
        <p>A Quick Note on Terminology
            Whenever I use new terms, I'll do my best to define them.
            
            But there are a few terms I'll be saying all the time.
            
            I'll use the words "programming" and "coding" interchangeably.
            
            I'll use the word "app" as it was intended â€“ as shorthand for any sort of application, regardless of whether it runs on a phone, laptop, game console, or refrigerator. (Sorry, Steve Jobs. iPhone does not have a monopoly on the word app.)
            
            I will also use the words "software engineer" and "software developer" interchangeably.
            
            You may encounter people in tech who take issue with this. As though software engineering is some fancy-pants field with a multi-century legacy, like mechanical engineering or civil engineering. And maybe that will be true for your grandkids. But we are still very much in the early days of software development as a field.
            
            I'll just drop this quote here for you:
            
            "If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization." â€“ Gerald Weinberg, Programmer, Author, and University Professor
            Can Anyone Learn to Code?
            Yes. I believe that any sufficiently motivated person can learn to code. At the end of the day, learning to code is a motivational challenge â€“ not a question of aptitude.
            
            On the savannas of Africa â€“ where early humans lived for thousands of years before spreading to Europe, Asia, and the Americas â€“ were there computers?
            
            Programming skills were never something that was selected for over the millennia. Computers as we know them (desktops, laptops, smartphones) emerged in the 80s, 90s, and 00s.
            
            Yes â€“ I do believe that aptitude and interest play a part. But at the end of the day, anyone who wants to become a professional developer will need to put in time at the keyboard.
            
            A vast majority of people who try to learn to code will get frustrated and give up.
            
            I sure did. I got frustrated and gave up. Several times.
            
            But like other people who eventually succeeded, I kept coming back after a few days, and tried again.
            
            I say all this because I want to acknowledge: learning to code and getting a developer job is hard. And it's even harder for some people than others, due to circumstance.
            
            I'm not going to pretend to have faced true adversity in learning to code. Yes, I was in my 30s, and I had no formal background in programming or computers science. But consider this:
            
            I grew up middle class in the United States â€“ a 4th-generation American from an English-speaking home. I went to university. My father went to university. And his father went to university. (His parents before him were farmers from Sweden.)
            
            I benefitted from a sort of intergenerational privilege. A momentum that some families are able to pick up over time when they are not torn apart by war, famine, or slavery.
            
            So that is my giant caveat to you: I am not some motivational figure to pump you up to overcome adversity.
            
            There are a ton of people in the developer community who have overcome real adversity. And I'll reference those people later in the book if you want to seek out their teachings.
            
            I'm not seeking to elevate the field of software development. I'm not going to paint pictures of science fiction utopias that can come about if you learn to code.
            
            Instead, I'm just going to give you practical tips for how you can acquire these skills. And how you can go get a good job, so you can provide for your family.
            
            There's nothing wrong with learning to code because you want a good, stable job.
            
            There's nothing wrong with learning to code so you can start a business.
            
            You may encounter people who say that you must be so passionate about coding that you dream about it. That you clock out of your full-time job, then spend all weekend contributing to open source projects.
            
            I do know people who are that passionate about coding. But I also know plenty of people who, after finishing a hard week's work, just want to go spend time in nature, or play board games with friends.
            
            People generally enjoy doing things they're good at doing. And you can develop a reasonable level of passion for coding just by getting better at coding.
            
            So in short: who is this book for? Anyone who wants to get better at coding, and get a job as a developer. That's it.
            
            You don't need to be a self-proclaimed "geek", an introvert, or an ideologically-driven activist. Or any of those stereotypes.
            
            It's fine if you are. But you don't need to be.
            
            So if that's you â€“ if you're serious about learning to code well enough to get paid to code â€“ this book is for you.
            
            And you should start by reading this quick summary of the book. And then reading the rest of it.
            
            500 Word Executive Summary
            Learning to code is hard. Getting a job as a software developer is even harder. But for many people, it's worth the effort.
            
            Coding is a high-paying, intellectually challenging, creatively rewarding field. There is a clear career progression ahead of you: senior developer, tech lead, engineering manager, CTO, and perhaps even CEO.
            
            You can find work in just about any industry. About two thirds of developer jobs are outside of what we traditionally call "tech" â€“ in agriculture, manufacturing, government, and service industries like banking and healthcare.
            
            If you're worried your job might be automated before you reach retirement, consider this: coding is the act of automating things. Thus it is by definition the last career that will be completely automated.
            
            Have I've sold you on coding as a good career for you? Then here's what you need to do to break into the field.</p>
